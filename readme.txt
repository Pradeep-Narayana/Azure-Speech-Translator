Project to recognize and synthesize speech and translate it to other languages using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.

The Translator project recognizes the speech either by the user's microphone or via the file "station.wav".
It then synthesizes the speech and translates it to the language specified by the user.
The translated text is then displayed on the screen and also spoken aloud.
